          name: "Arthur Benison Hubback", img: "./assets/hubback.png",
          bg: "Born on 13 April 1871 in Liverpool, England, Arthur Benison Hubback was a distinguished British Army officer and architect. After completing his architectural training in Liverpool, he arrived in Malaya in 1895. He quickly rose through the ranks, becoming the chief government architect of the Federated Malay States by 1900. Uniquely, Hubback was also a dedicated soldier. Unlike many of his contemporaries, he paused his architectural career to serve in World War I, commanding troops in France and eventually reaching the rank of Brigadier General. He remained in the army until his retirement in 1924, leaving a legacy of discipline and artistry.",
          con: "Hubback is celebrated for defining the architectural identity of British Malaya through the 'Indo-Saracenic' style. His masterpieces include the Jamek Mosque (1909), the Kuala Lumpur Railway Station (1910), and the National Textile Museum. Under the direction of Charles Edwin Spooner, Hubback moved away from traditional European styles to incorporate Mughal elements like onion domes, chatris, and horse-shoe arches. This fusion style became the visual symbol of the colonial administration's respect for Islamic culture. His buildings were not just functional; they were grand statements of state power dressed in elegant, oriental attire.",
          task: { title: "Jamek Mosque", desc: "Spooner demands an Indo-Saracenic roof. Choose it!" },

          name: "A.C. Norman", img: "./assets/norman.png",
          bg: "Arthur Charles Alfred Norman (1858-1944) was a British architect who played a foundational role in the development of Kuala Lumpur. He arrived in Selangor in 1883, working initially as an Assistant Superintendent before becoming the Government Architect in 1890. He served until 1903, a period of rapid transformation for the city. Although his tenure ended with a compulsory retirement on grounds of 'inefficiency' at age 45, his early contributions laid the groundwork for the capital's historic core. He later returned to England, continuing his practice in Norwich and Plymouth.",
          con: "Norman is credited with the ground plan of the iconic Sultan Abdul Samad Building, although the elevation was later reworked by Bidwell. His other significant contributions include the St. Mary's Church (1894), Pudu Prison (1895), and the original Selangor Club. Norman's style was eclectic; he introduced the 'blood and bandage' style of exposed brickwork combined with plaster. While his initial designs for the government offices were in a Classic Renaissance style (which was rejected), his structural planning enabled the creation of the grand historic buildings we see around Dataran Merdeka today.",
          task: { title: "Sultan Abdul Samad", desc: "Norman drew the floor plan. Now add the roof!" },

          name: "R.A.J Bidwell", img: "./assets/bidwell.png",
          bg: "Regent Alfred John Bidwell (1869-1918) was a talented architect born in South London. He received his training with Lockyer, Son, & Cox in London and was a member of the Architectural Association. In 1893, he moved to Malaya to work for the Selangor Public Works Department (PWD). Bidwell was known for his artistic flair and ability to adapt to changing demands. He was the unsung hero behind many of Kuala Lumpur's most famous facades, often working under the shadow of his superiors like Norman and Spooner.",
          con: "Bidwell's most significant contribution was the visual design of the Sultan Abdul Samad Building. Originally, he designed the elevation in a Classic Renaissance style. However, the State Engineer, Charles Edwin Spooner, rejected this look, demanding something 'Mahometan' (Islamic) to suit the local culture. Bidwell displayed immense versatility by completely reworking the design into the Neo-Mughal (Indo-Saracenic) masterpiece that stands today. He successfully integrated onion domes and arched colonnades on top of Norman's floor plan, effectively introducing the onion dome to the Malayan architectural vocabulary.",
          task: { title: "Change the Style", desc: "Spooner rejected Renaissance. Switch to Indo-Saracenic!" },

As the State Engineer of the Selangor Public Works Department and later the General Manager of the Federated Malay States Railways, Spooner held the power to shape the entire physical landscape of Kuala Lumpur. He was known for his ambitious building programs and his decisive nature, often overruling architects to ensure buildings met his specific aesthetic and functional vision.",
          con: "Spooner was the mastermind behind the adoption of the 'Islamic' style for Kuala Lumpur's government buildings. He famously rejected the Western Classic Renaissance designs for the Sultan Abdul Samad Building, insisting instead on a style he described as 'Mahometan' to reflect the local religion and climate. This decision changed the course of Malaysian architectural history, leading to the construction of the KL Railway Station and Jamek Mosque in similar styles. He also reorganized the railway system, creating the backbone of the nation's transport infrastructure.",

He shared a close professional relationship with Malaysia's first Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, who trusted him with projects of immense national importance.",
          con: "Jewkes' crowning achievement is the design and construction of Stadium Merdeka (Independence Stadium). He was tasked with building this historic venue in time for the formal declaration of independence on August 31, 1957. Under immense pressure, he designed a stadium that was not only an engineering marvel of its time—with the world's tallest prestressed concrete floodlight towers—but also a symbol of the new nation's hopes. He also designed Stadium Negara and the Klang Gates Dam, contributing significantly to the modern infrastructure of Kuala Lumpur.",

As one of the first qualified Malay architects, he sought to create a modern architectural language that respected traditional Malay culture and Islam while embracing progressive, democratic values.",
          con: "Baharuddin is best known as the chief architect of the National Mosque (Masjid Negara). Breaking away from the colonial Indo-Saracenic domes, he introduced a modernist approach. His design features a unique 16-pointed star concrete main roof, resembling an open umbrella, and a 73-meter minaret that looks like a folded umbrella. This 'Umbrella' concept was chosen to represent the tropics and the protection of the King (whose symbol is the yellow umbrella). Completed in 1965, the mosque stands as a bold icon of Malaysia's modern identity.",
